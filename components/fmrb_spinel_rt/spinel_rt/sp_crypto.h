/* sp_crypto.h -- Compact SHA-256 / HMAC / PBKDF2 / Base64URL / CSPRNG
 *
 * Pure C, no spinel-runtime dependency. Intended for spinel programs
 * that need a small in-tree crypto surface without dragging in
 * OpenSSL or libsodium. Sibling to sp_bigint.{h,c} in scope: a
 * vendored, audit-sized C helper that ships with spinel so apps
 * don't each reinvent it.
 *
 * The seven functions below are the canonical surface tep ended up
 * with after a year of building on the same primitives -- if you
 * find yourself wanting a different shape, please file an issue
 * before adding to this list. The point is to keep the surface
 * small enough to read in one sitting.
 *
 * Naming
 * ------
 * All exported symbols use the `sp_crypto_` prefix (matches the
 * `sp_bigint_` convention). State buffers are per-function statics
 * -- the next call to the same function clobbers the buffer, so
 * copy on the caller side if the value must outlive the next call.
 *
 * Inputs
 * ------
 * String inputs are NUL-terminated. Length is taken via strlen()
 * inside each function. For binary-safe inputs (containing embedded
 * NULs), use the explicit-length internal API exposed by including
 * this header in your own .c file -- see sp_crypto.c for the
 * declarations.
 *
 * Thread safety
 * -------------
 * The return buffers are SP_TLS, so an answer belongs to the thread
 * that asked for it. The clobber rule above still holds, per thread:
 * the next call to the same function on the SAME thread overwrites
 * it, and a caller that needs the value to outlive that call still
 * copies.
 *
 * They were process-global until #4174, whose SecureRandom draw made
 * the cost visible -- eight threads minting tokens got about a third
 * of them from another thread's buffer. Every function here has the
 * same window, because every call site copies out of the buffer after
 * the call has RETURNED. "Caller-side serialize" was not a contract
 * a caller could keep: Digest::SHA256.hexdigest is an ordinary Ruby
 * method with nothing at the call site to serialize against.
 *
 * SP_TLS is __thread only in the -DSP_THREADS runtime variant, so a
 * program that never threads pays nothing: its sp_crypto.o is the
 * byte-identical object it was. The threaded variant pays the buffers
 * per WORKER -- ~32 KiB of that is the two 16 KiB base64url buffers
 * and everything else together is under 600 bytes -- and the worker
 * pool is bounded by min(cores, SPINEL_WORKERS), not by the number of
 * Ruby threads the program starts.
